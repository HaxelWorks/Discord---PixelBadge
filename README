Displays notifications on your PixelBadge when people enter/leave a server
This works by having a discord bot on your server communicate with the PixelBadge
You can [invite the bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=931992288798847048&permissions=1024&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
or host your own
